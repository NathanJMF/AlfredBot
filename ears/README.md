# AlfredBot - Ears
Alfred's ears is the discord bot which users can interact with to trigger different functionality.

This is separate to the QUART API which now runs the ML models as running the LLM inside the Discord bot would make all threads busy,
stopping the bot from sending out the required consistent heart beat to Discord, causing Discord to time out the bot and the bot to miss messages.
